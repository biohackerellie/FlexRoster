## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- OneRoster API credentials from Infinite Campus
- Azure AD application with SAML integration
- Docker - `https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/`
- Nodejs - `https://nodejs.org/en/`
- Pnpm - `https://pnpm.io/installation`
- Turborepo - `https://turbo.build/repo/docs`
- If you wish to compile the CLI from source, you will need Go installed - `https://golang.org/doc/install`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` and `.env.config.example` to `.env` and `.env.config` respectively, and fill in the required values. _`.env` is for the backend and `.env.config` is for the CLI._

3. Run the deploy.sh script to deploy the stack to docker. This will handle building the front end, back end, redis, postgres, and socketi services and deploying the containers to the server.

```bash
sudo ./deploy.sh
```


4. Download the Cli tar from github releases and extract it to your local machine. _Make sure to replace the version number with the latest release._

```bash
curl -OL https://github.com/biohackerellie/FlexRoster/releases/download/v1.4.0/FlexRoster_1.4.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz && sudo tar  -C /usr/local/bin -xzf FlexRoster_1.4.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz

```

5. You need to add 2 lines to your profile at `.bashrc/.zshrc` or globally at `/etc/profile` to allow the CLI to be run from anywhere.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin # Likely already in your profile
export FLEXROOT=/path/to/your/flexroster/repo
```

6. Party! You're all set up! ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

You can now run the cli tool to adjust any settings you need to. The env.config file contains all of the fields likely to change during production such as admin users, semester dates, and the school name. The CLI tool will allow you to adjust these settings as needed. just run `flex` to see the available commands.
