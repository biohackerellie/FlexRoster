Flex students are always one of three statuses: - DEFAULT: This student is in their default assigned class. - TRANSFER, NOT ARRIVED: This student has requested to be in your class, but has not been marked as arrived for the day. - TRANSFER, ARRIVED: This student has requested to be in your class, and has been marked as arrived for the day.

### Marking Students as Arrived

  When a student has been approved to transfer to your class for the day, they
  will show up on your roster list with a red status. ![not

## Setting Availability and Class Comments

<Callout>
  Above your roster, on the right hand side, you'll find the options for setting
  your availability and your class ccomments.

</Callout>

### Setting Availability

Your availability determines which days students can request to transfer to your class. By default all days are marked unavailable so students will not be able to request access to your room until you set your availability.

You can set your availability two different ways. The red thumbs down icon currently indicates your current availability for the current day. Clicking on it will change your class to available just for that day, and the icon will now be green with a thumbs up. Click it again to make the day unavailable.

You can also click on the `Add Availability` button to open a pop up window where you can select the days you would like to make available. You can select one or a range of future days to make available.

### Class Comments

Your class comments are visible to students when they request to transfer to your class. You can use this space to provide any information you think would be helpful for the student to know.

<Callout type="info">
  Click the Add Comment button to open a pop up window where you can type your
  comment. ![Add
