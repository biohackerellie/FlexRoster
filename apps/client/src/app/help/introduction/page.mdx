## What is FlexRoster?

If you're on this page, you probably know by now that your school has decided to use FlexRoster. FlexRoster is an application for students and teachers to manage their schedules for flexible learning periods.

This application syncs with your districs student rostering system, so all students and teachers will have access to their default assigned schedules, then can use FlexRoster to make changes to their daily availability. `Students` can use FlexRoster to request to be in a specific teacher's class, while `Teachers` can use FlexRoster to approve or deny student requests, and set their own availability for students to request.

## Getting Started

You will need to login to FlexRoster using your school email and password, by clicking the login button on the homepage
