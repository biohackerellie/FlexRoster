* The new Page displays a calendar. Your days you have set available will be
highlighted.

  <Callout type="info">
    By default, FlexRoster classrooms are generated from existing classes in the
    infinite campus system with that have the school's ID. Some times teachers,
    or other staff members may need to create a new classroom that does not
    exist in the infinite campus system. This feature allows them to do so,
    however there will be no students assigned by default. If you are certain
    you should have a roster for Flex, please contact your school's IT
    department.
